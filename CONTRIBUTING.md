# Contributing to Belmont

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Belmont! Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, and new skills or agents.

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/belmont.git
cd belmont
```

2. Make sure you have **Go 1.21+** installed.

3. Verify you can build:

```bash
go build ./cmd/belmont
```

> **Note:** `go build` and `go run` produce dev-mode binaries without embedded skills/agents. This is expected — see [Dev vs Release Builds](#dev-vs-release-builds) below.

## Development Workflow

### Running the CLI in dev mode

```bash
# Run commands directly
go run ./cmd/belmont status --root /path/to/project
go run ./cmd/belmont tree
go run ./cmd/belmont version

# Install skills into a project (requires --source since dev builds have no embedded files)
go run ./cmd/belmont install --source . --project ~/your-project --no-prompt
```

### Testing local skill/agent changes

The fastest way to iterate on skills or agents is the `--source` flag. Edit any file under `skills/` or `agents/`, then re-install into a real project:

```bash
# From the belmont repo root
go run ./cmd/belmont install --source . --project ~/your-project --no-prompt
```

This reads directly from your working tree — no rebuild, no git push, no release needed. Every time you save a skill file, re-run the command and the target project gets the update immediately.

**Tip:** Create an alias for faster iteration:

```bash
alias bdev="go run $(pwd)/cmd/belmont install --source $(pwd)"

# Then from any project directory:
bdev --project ~/your-project --no-prompt
```

### Dev vs Release Builds

|                               | Dev build (`go build`) | Release build (`scripts/build.sh`) |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Skills/agents embedded        | No                     | Yes                                |
| `install` requires `--source` | Yes                    | No                                 |
| Version info                  | `dev`                  | Injected (e.g. `0.2.0`)            |
| Build tag                     | `!embed`               | `embed`                            |

To produce a release-style build locally:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh          # version defaults to "dev"
./scripts/build.sh 0.3.0    # specific version

# Output goes to dist/
./dist/belmont-darwin-arm64 version
```

## Making Changes

### Skills and Agents

Skills live in `skills/belmont/` and agents in `agents/belmont/`. Some skills are **generated from templates** — check whether a `_src/` counterpart exists before editing.

#### Editing workflow

1. **Check if the skill has a template**: Look in `skills/belmont/_src/` for a file with the same name.
   - **If yes** → edit the `_src/` template (and/or `_partials/` if changing shared content), then run `scripts/generate-skills.sh`
   - **If no** → edit the file in `skills/belmont/` directly (e.g., `status.md`, `reset.md`)

2. **Shared partials** (`skills/belmont/_partials/`): Reusable content blocks included by templates. Partials support `{{variable}}` placeholders that are filled in by each template's `@include` directive.

3. **Dispatch strategy** (`skills/belmont/_partials/dispatch-strategy.md`): The shared sub-agent dispatch model. Included at build time by orchestrator skill templates (implement, verify) via `@include`. Edit the partial, then run `generate-skills.sh`.

4. **Agent files** (`agents/belmont/*-agent.md`): Edit directly. No generation involved.

#### After any skill/agent change

```bash
# Regenerate (if you edited _src/ or _partials/)
./scripts/generate-skills.sh

# Test by installing into a project
go run ./cmd/belmont install --source . --project ~/your-project --no-prompt
```

#### Quick reference

| What to edit                         | Where                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Shared dispatch logic                | `skills/belmont/_partials/dispatch-strategy.md` → run `generate-skills.sh` |
| Identity preamble, forbidden actions | `skills/belmont/_partials/` → run `generate-skills.sh` |
| Skill-specific content (templated)   | `skills/belmont/_src/` → run `generate-skills.sh`      |
| Skill-specific content (standalone)  | `skills/belmont/status.md`, `reset.md`                 |
| Agent instructions                   | `agents/belmont/*-agent.md`                            |

### CLI (Go code)

All CLI logic is in `cmd/belmont/main.go`. There are no external dependencies. After making changes, verify it compiles:

```bash
go build ./cmd/belmont
```

There is no test suite or linter configured. Verify changes by compiling and manually testing the relevant commands.

### Documentation

If your change affects CLI behavior, installation, or usage, update the README accordingly.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature
```

2. Make your changes and verify they compile.

3. Test the affected commands manually.

4. Commit with a clear message describing the change.

5. Push and open a PR against `main`.

### What makes a good PR

- **Focused** — one logical change per PR.
- **Tested** — you've verified the change works (compile + manual testing).
- **Documented** — README updated if user-facing behavior changed.
- **Small** — easier to review, faster to merge.

## Release Process

Releases are cut by maintainers:

```bash
# 1. Prepare release (generates changelog, commits, tags)
./scripts/release.sh 0.3.0

# 2. Push to trigger GitHub Actions
git push origin main --tags
```

GitHub Actions cross-compiles for darwin/linux/windows (amd64 + arm64), generates checksums, and creates a GitHub Release.
