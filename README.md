# Belmont AI

A toolkit for running structured coding sessions with AI coding agents. Belmont manages a PRD (Product Requirements Document), orchestrates specialized sub-agent phases, and tracks progress across milestones.

**Agent-agnostic** -- works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, and any tool that can read markdown files. No Docker required. No loops. Just skills and agents.

A flexible PRD system has been used to provide the best level of context from plan to implementation. Tech plans allow you to specify specifics for the agent to follow while building.

Strong guardrails are in place to keep the agent focused and on task.

**Working Backwards (PR/FAQ)** -- Belmont supports Amazon's Working Backwards methodology as a strategic first step. Define your product vision with a PR/FAQ document before breaking it into features and tasks.

**Figma-first design workflow** -- Belmont is built heavily around understanding Figma designs. The design-agent extracts exact tokens (colors, typography, spacing), maps them to your design system, and produces implementation-ready component specs. The verification-agent compares your implementation against the Figma source using Playwright headless screenshots. For the best experience, install [figma-mcp](https://github.com/nichochar/figma-mcp) so Belmont can load and analyze your designs automatically.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install belmont (one-time)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blake-simpson/belmont/main/install.sh | sh

# Set up your project
cd ~/your-project
belmont install
```

The installer detects which AI tools you have (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and installs skills to `.agents/skills/belmont/`, then links or copies them into each tool's native directory. Agents are installed to `.agents/belmont/`.

Then use the skills in your AI tool of choice. For example, in Claude Code:

```
/belmont:product-plan
/belmont:implement
/belmont:next
/belmont:status
```

---

## How It Works

Belmont breaks coding work into **phases**, each driven by a specialized agent. The user interacts through **skills** (markdown files loaded as slash commands or rules) that orchestrate these agents.

```

### MILESTONE File Architecture

Belmont uses a **MILESTONE file** (`.belmont/MILESTONE.md`) as the shared context between agents. Instead of the orchestrator passing large outputs between agents in their prompts, each agent reads from and writes to this single file. This dramatically reduces token usage and keeps each agent focused.

```
Orchestrator
    │
    ├─ 1. Creates MILESTONE.md with task list, PRD context & TECH_PLAN context
    │
    ├─ 2. Research phases (parallel — both run simultaneously):
    │     ├─ codebase-agent ─── reads MILESTONE.md + codebase ── writes Codebase Analysis section
    │     └─ design-agent ───── reads MILESTONE.md + Figma ──── writes Design Specifications section
    │
    ├─ 3. Spawns implementation-agent ── reads MILESTONE.md ── writes code + Implementation Log
    │
    └─ 4. Archives MILESTONE.md → MILESTONE-M2.done.md
```

Each agent reads **only the MILESTONE file** — the orchestrator extracts all relevant PRD and TECH_PLAN context into it upfront. Agents receive a minimal prompt (just identity + "read the MILESTONE file"). The orchestrator's context stays flat — it never accumulates the massive outputs from each phase. This helps save tokens & prevent hallucinations.

### Implementation Pipeline

When you run the implement skill, the orchestrator creates a MILESTONE file, then dispatches 3 phases. Phases 1 and 2 run in parallel, Phase 3 runs after both complete:

| Phase              | Agent                  | Model  | Reads                | Writes to MILESTONE                  |
|--------------------|------------------------|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1. Codebase Scan   | `codebase-agent`       | Sonnet | MILESTONE + codebase | `## Codebase Analysis`               |
| 2. Design Analysis | `design-agent`         | Sonnet | MILESTONE + Figma    | `## Design Specifications`           |
| 3. Implementation  | `implementation-agent` | Opus   | MILESTONE (only)     | Code, tests, `## Implementation Log` |

After implementation, the MILESTONE file is archived (renamed to `MILESTONE-[ID].done.md`) to prevent stale context from bleeding into the next milestone.

### Verification Pipeline

When you run the verify skill, two agents run:

| Agent                | Model  | What It Does                                                                                        |
|----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `verification-agent` | Sonnet | Checks acceptance criteria, visual Figma comparison via Playwright headless, i18n keys              |
| `code-review-agent`  | Sonnet | Runs build and test commands (auto-detects package manager), reviews code quality and PRD alignment |

Both agents read the PRD, TECH_PLAN, and archived MILESTONE files for full context. Any issues found become follow-up tasks added to the PRD and PROGRESS files.

---

## Implementation Pipeline

Research phases 1–2 (codebase scan + design analysis) are fully independent — they each read from the `## Orchestrator Context` section of the MILESTONE file and write to their own designated section (`## Codebase Analysis`, `## Design Specifications`). This makes them safe to run in parallel with no conflicts. Phase 3 (implementation) always runs after both research phases complete.

```

## Agent Teams / Swarms Support

By default, Belmont dispatches all phases as **sub-agents**. This is the most reliable approach and works with every supported tool.

If your environment supports **agent teams** (e.g. Claude Code's multi-agent feature), Belmont's orchestrator skills will take advantage, if Claude thinks it would add value. If not it will use traditional sub-agents. No changes to Belmont's configuration are needed — just enable agent teams in your tool and the orchestrator will use them when appropriate.

## Working Backwards (PR/FAQ)

Belmont supports Amazon's **Working Backwards** methodology — a product definition process that starts with the customer and works backwards to the solution. The centerpiece is the **PR/FAQ**: a one-page press release describing the product as if it's already launched, followed by FAQs that force clarity on every aspect of the idea.

### Why PR/FAQ?

Traditional product development often starts with solutions and works forward to find customers. Working Backwards reverses this: you write the press release first, then figure out how to build what you promised. This forces you to:

- **Define the customer precisely** — not "users" but "enterprise procurement managers at companies with 500+ employees"
- **Articulate the single most important benefit** — if you can't say it in one sentence, the idea isn't clear enough
- **Eliminate vague thinking** — no weasel words, no adjectives without data, no magic solutions
- **Surface hard questions early** — the FAQ section forces you to confront trade-offs, risks, and alternatives before writing any code

### How It Fits Into Belmont

The PR/FAQ is an optional but recommended first step in Belmont's workflow:

```
/belmont:working-backwards  →  .belmont/PR_FAQ.md  (strategic vision)
        ↓
/belmont:product-plan       →  .belmont/PRD.md     (feature catalog + detailed PRDs)
        ↓
/belmont:tech-plan          →  TECH_PLAN.md        (master + feature implementation specs)
        ↓
/belmont:implement          →  Code                (agent pipeline)
```

The PR/FAQ feeds into product planning — when you run `/belmont:product-plan`, it reads the PR/FAQ for strategic context, ensuring your features align with the customer promise.

## Sub-Feature Architecture

For products with multiple features, Belmont supports a **sub-feature directory structure** that keeps each feature's planning state isolated while maintaining a master product view.

### File Structure

```
.belmont/
  PR_FAQ.md                    ← Strategic vision (created by /belmont:working-backwards)
  PRD.md                       ← Master PRD (feature catalog)
  TECH_PLAN.md                 ← Master tech plan (cross-cutting architecture)
  features/
    user-authentication/
      PRD.md                   ← Feature-specific requirements + tasks
      TECH_PLAN.md             ← Feature-specific technical plan
      PROGRESS.md              ← Milestones + task tracking
      MILESTONE.md             ← Active implementation context
      MILESTONE-M1.done.md     ← Archived milestones
    payment-processing/
      PRD.md
      TECH_PLAN.md
      PROGRESS.md
```

### How It Works

- **Master files** persist at the product level — the PR/FAQ, master PRD (feature catalog), and master tech plan (cross-cutting architecture)
- **Feature directories** contain the detailed planning state for each feature — isolated PRDs, tech plans, progress tracking, and milestone files
- **Skills prompt for feature selection** — when running any skill, you select or create the feature to work on
- **Reset is granular** — reset a single feature, all features, or everything including masters

## Installation

### Install (one command)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blake-simpson/belmont/main/install.sh | sh
```

This downloads the latest release binary to `~/.local/bin/belmont`. Make sure it's in your PATH:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc (if not already)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

You can override the install directory with `BELMONT_INSTALL_DIR`:

```bash
BELMONT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blake-simpson/belmont/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Per-Project Setup

Navigate to your project and run:

```bash
cd ~/your-project
belmont install
```

Release binaries have all skills and agents embedded -- no source directory needed. You can also pass options:

```bash
# Target a different project folder
belmont install --project /path/to/project

# Limit tool setup and disable prompts
belmont install --tools claude,codex --no-prompt
```

### Developer Setup (contributors)

If you've cloned the repo and want to build from source:

```bash
# Build with embedded content
./scripts/build.sh

# Or use the dev installer (builds + records source path)
./bin/install.sh --setup

# Run during development (requires --source flag since go run has no embedded files)
go run ./cmd/belmont install --source . --project /tmp/test-project --no-prompt
```

The installer will:

1. **Scan for AI tools** -- detects `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`, `.gemini/`, `.copilot/`
2. **Ask which to install for** -- all detected, a specific one, or skip
3. **Sync agents** to `.agents/belmont/` (shared, tool-agnostic)
4. **Sync skills** to `.agents/skills/belmont/` (canonical location, shared across tools)
5. **For Codex installs, update `AGENTS.md`** with Belmont skill-routing guidance (idempotent)
6. **For Codex installs, remove legacy Belmont `SKILLS.md`** at project root (if present)
7. **Link or copy** skill files into each selected tool's native directory
8. **Clean stale files** -- if a skill was renamed or removed in source, the old file is deleted from the target
9. **Create `.belmont/`** directory with PR_FAQ.md, PRD.md templates and `features/` directory (if they don't exist). The master PROGRESS.md is created by the product-plan skill when the first feature is planned.

Example output:

If no AI tool directories are found, the installer asks which tool you want to set up and creates the directory for you.

## CLI Commands

Belmont ships a small Go CLI (`belmont`) for status checks, file queries, and self-updating. Install via the curl one-liner above, or on Windows use `./bin/install.ps1` for a project-local helper.

Example usage:

```bash
belmont install                         # Install skills/agents into current project
belmont update                          # Update to latest release
belmont update --check                  # Check for updates without installing
belmont status                          # View project progress
belmont status --format json            # Machine-readable status
belmont status --feature auth           # Feature-specific status
belmont tree --max-depth 3              # Project tree
belmont find --name PRD --type file     # Find files
belmont search --pattern "TECH_PLAN"    # Search file contents
belmont version                         # Show version, commit, build date
```

Skills prefer these helpers when available:
- `status` uses `belmont status` first
- `product-plan` and `tech-plan` may use `belmont tree`/`search` (or `find`) for quick structure/pattern checks
- `implement`, `next`, `verify`, and `reset` may use `belmont status --format json` for summaries (still read `.belmont` files for full context)

Windows build example (project-local helper):

```powershell
go build -o .belmont\\bin\\belmont.exe ./cmd/belmont
```

Windows helper install script:

```powershell
pwsh ./bin/install.ps1
```

## Supported Tools

Agents and skills are always installed to `.agents/` -- the single source of truth shared across all tools.

Each AI tool is wired to `.agents/skills/belmont/` in the way it expects. Some tools use symlinks, while others get a copied/synced directory:

| Tool               | Symlink                                                 | Target                                                                                    | How to Use                                                            |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Claude Code**    | `.claude/agents/belmont`<br/>`.claude/commands/belmont` | `agents -> .agents/belmont` (symlink)<br/>`commands` copied from `.agents/skills/belmont` | Slash commands: `/belmont:product-plan`, `/belmont:implement`, etc.   |
| **Codex**          | `.codex/belmont`                                        | Copied from `.agents/skills/belmont`                                                      | `AGENTS.md` includes Belmont routing for `belmont:<skill>` prompts    |
| **Cursor**         | `.cursor/rules/belmont/*.mdc`                           | `→ .agents/skills/belmont/*.md`                                                           | Toggle rules in Settings > Rules, or reference in Composer/Agent mode |
| **Windsurf**       | `.windsurf/rules/belmont`                               | Symlink to `.agents/skills/belmont`                                                       | Reference rules in Cascade                                            |
| **Gemini**         | `.gemini/rules/belmont`                                 | Symlink to `.agents/skills/belmont`                                                       | Reference rules in Gemini                                             |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.copilot/belmont`                                      | Symlink to `.agents/skills/belmont`                                                       | Reference files in Copilot Chat                                       |
| **Any other tool** | *(none)*                                                | `.agents/skills/belmont/`                                                                 | Point your tool at the skill files directly                           |

Cursor uses per-file symlinks. Windsurf/Gemini/Copilot use a directory symlink. Claude Code and Codex use copied skill files.

/belmont:reset          Reset state and start fresh
```

### Codex Usage

Skills are copied into `.codex/belmont/`, and Belmont adds/updates a small section in `AGENTS.md` so Codex can resolve local Belmont skills. To use them:

1. Open Codex in your project directory
2. Prompt with a skill reference like `belmont:implement` or "Use the belmont:implement skill"
3. Codex should resolve `.agents/skills/belmont/implement.md` (fallback `.codex/belmont/implement.md`)
4. You can still point Codex at the skill file directly when starting a session

### Cursor Usage

Skills are installed as rules (`.mdc` files). To use them:

1. Open **Settings > Cursor Settings > Rules**
2. You'll see the belmont rules listed (product-plan, tech-plan, implement, next, verify, status, reset)
3. Enable the one you want to activate
4. Start a Composer or Agent session -- the rule will be loaded as context
5. Or reference them directly: *"Follow the belmont implement workflow"*

In the **Cursor Agent CLI**, you can reference the skill files directly:

```bash
cursor agent --rules .cursor/rules/belmont/implement.mdc
```

### Generic / Other Tools

If your tool isn't auto-detected, the agent and skill files are still plain markdown. Point your tool at:

- **Skills**: Read from `.agents/skills/belmont/` (or wherever you've placed them)
- **Agents**: `.agents/belmont/codebase-agent.md`, `implementation-agent.md`, etc.
- **State**: `.belmont/PR_FAQ.md`, `.belmont/PRD.md`, `.belmont/PROGRESS.md` (master feature summary), `.belmont/TECH_PLAN.md`, `.belmont/MILESTONE.md`, `.belmont/features/`

You can paste the skill content directly into a chat or configure your tool to load it as system context.

## Skills Reference

### `working-backwards`

Amazon-style Working Backwards document creation. Produces a PR/FAQ with press release, FAQs, and appendix.

- Guides you through customer definition, problem statement, and solution
- Writes a one-page press release with leader quote and customer testimonial
- Creates external (customer) and internal (stakeholder) FAQs
- Includes appendix with product backlog, KPIs, and competitive analysis
- Enforces writing quality: no weasel words, data over adjectives, under 30 words per sentence
- Does NOT create PRDs or implementation plans — that comes next

**Output**: `.belmont/PR_FAQ.md`

### `product-plan`

Interactive planning session. Creates the PRD and PROGRESS files. Supports multi-feature products with a master PRD (feature catalog) and per-feature PRDs.

- Asks clarifying questions one at a time until the plan is concrete
- Creates structured PRD with prioritized tasks (P0-P3)
- Organizes tasks into milestones in PROGRESS.md
- Includes Figma URLs, acceptance criteria, verification steps
- Does NOT implement anything -- plan mode only

**Output**: `.belmont/PRD.md`, `.belmont/PROGRESS.md` (master feature summary), `.belmont/features/<slug>/PRD.md`, `.belmont/features/<slug>/PROGRESS.md`

### `tech-plan`

Technical planning session. Creates a detailed implementation specification.

- Requires an existing PRD (run plan first)
- Acts as a senior architect reviewing and refining the plan
- Loads Figma designs and extracts exact design tokens
- Produces concrete file structures, component skeletons, API types
- Maps PRD tasks to specific code sections
- Interactive Q&A until both you and the AI are confident

**Output**: `.belmont/TECH_PLAN.md`

### `implement`

Implements the next pending milestone from the PRD.

- Reads PROGRESS.md to find the first incomplete milestone
- Creates a **MILESTONE file** (`.belmont/MILESTONE.md`) with orchestrator context
- Runs 3 agents, each reading from and writing to the MILESTONE file:
  1. **Codebase Scan** (codebase-agent) -- Reads MILESTONE + codebase, writes `## Codebase Analysis` *(parallel with 2)*
  2. **Design Analysis** (design-agent) -- Reads MILESTONE + Figma, writes `## Design Specifications` *(parallel with 1)*
  3. **Implementation** (implementation-agent) -- Reads MILESTONE only, writes code + `## Implementation Log` *(after 1+2)*
- After each task: marks it complete in PRD.md, updates PROGRESS.md
- After all milestone tasks: marks the milestone complete
- **Archives the MILESTONE file** (`MILESTONE-M2.done.md`) to keep context clean for next run
- Creates follow-up tasks (FWLUP) for out-of-scope issues discovered during implementation
- Handles blockers gracefully -- marks blocked tasks and skips to the next

### `next`

Implements just the next single pending task — a lightweight alternative to the full implement pipeline.

- Reads PROGRESS.md to find the first unchecked task in the first pending milestone
- Creates a **minimal MILESTONE file** with just the single task's context (skips analysis agents)
- Dispatches the single task to the `implementation-agent` as a sub-agent
- After the task is done: marks it complete in PRD.md and PROGRESS.md
- If it was the last task in the milestone, marks the milestone complete
- **Archives the MILESTONE file** after completion
- Creates follow-up tasks (FWLUP) for any out-of-scope issues

**Best for**: Follow-up tasks from verification, small fixes, well-scoped isolated work.
**Use `/belmont:implement` instead for**: Large tasks, first tasks in a milestone, tasks needing Figma analysis.

### `verify`

Runs verification and code review on all completed tasks.

- Runs two agents **in parallel**:
  - **Verification Agent** -- Checks acceptance criteria, Figma pixel comparison (Playwright headless), i18n text keys, edge cases, accessibility
  - **Code Review Agent** -- Runs build and test commands (auto-detects package manager: npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun), reviews code against project patterns, checks PRD alignment
- Both agents read the PRD, TECH_PLAN, and archived MILESTONE files for full context
- Categorizes issues: Critical / Warnings / Suggestions
- Creates follow-up tasks in PRD.md and PROGRESS.md for anything that needs fixing
- Produces a combined summary report

### `review`

Reviews alignment between planning documents and the codebase. Detects drift, conflicts, and gaps across the entire document hierarchy.

- Compares PR/FAQ vision against master PRD feature catalog
- Checks each feature's PRD and tech plan against master documents
- Verifies task/milestone consistency between PRD and PROGRESS files
- Scans codebase for unplanned implementations or stale task statuses
- Presents each finding interactively with resolution options
- Can update PRDs, tech plans, PROGRESS files, and NOTES based on decisions
- Does NOT modify source code — planning audit only

**When to use**: After implementation sessions, before major milestones, or periodically to keep plans aligned with reality.

### `reset`

Reset belmont state. In feature mode, choose to reset a specific feature, all features, or everything including masters and PR/FAQ.

- Shows a summary of current state (feature name, task/milestone counts, completion status)
- Asks for explicit confirmation before resetting
- Resets PRD.md and PROGRESS.md to blank templates
- Deletes TECH_PLAN.md if it exists
- Does NOT touch agents, skills, or any source code

**Resets**: `.belmont/PR_FAQ.md`, `.belmont/PRD.md`, `.belmont/PROGRESS.md`, `.belmont/TECH_PLAN.md`, `.belmont/MILESTONE.md`, `.belmont/MILESTONE-*.done.md`, `.belmont/features/`

### `status`

Read-only progress report. Does not modify any files.

Example output (project-level):

```
Belmont Status
==============

Product: My App

PR/FAQ: ✅ Written
Master Tech Plan: ✅ Ready

Status: 🟡 In Progress

🟡 Chat Application (chat-app)

## Full Workflow

### 0. Define Product Vision (optional)

If you're building a product with multiple features, start with a PR/FAQ to define the strategic vision.

```
Claude Code:  /belmont:working-backwards
Cursor:       Enable the belmont working-backwards rule, then: "Let's define the product vision"
Other:        Load skills/belmont/working-backwards.md as context
```

**What happens:**
- You describe the product idea and target customer
- AI asks focused questions about the problem, solution, and key benefit
- AI writes a PR/FAQ: press release + customer/stakeholder FAQs + appendix
- AI writes `.belmont/PR_FAQ.md`

### 1. Install

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
belmont install
```

### 2. Plan

Start an interactive planning session. Describe what you want to build. The AI will ask clarifying questions, then write a structured PRD with prioritized tasks organized into milestones.

```
Claude Code:  /belmont:product-plan
Cursor:       Enable the belmont product-plan rule, then: "Let's plan a new feature"
Other:        Load skills/belmont/product-plan.md as context
```

**What happens:**
- You describe the feature
- AI asks questions one at a time (edge cases, dependencies, Figma URLs, etc.)
- You finalize the plan together
- AI writes `.belmont/PRD.md` and `.belmont/PROGRESS.md`

It is strongly recommended you read the PRD created yourself. You can manually make edits before tech plan/implementation or you can run `belmont:product-plan` again and tell it what to refine.

### 3. Tech Plan (recommended)

Have a senior architect agent review the PRD and produce a detailed technical plan. This step is optional but strongly recommended -- it produces the TECH_PLAN.md that guides the implementation agents.

You may add any additional context to the tech plan agent that you want to include.

```
Claude Code:  /belmont:tech-plan
Cursor:       Enable the belmont tech-plan rule, then: "Let's review the technical plan"
Other:        Load skills/belmont/tech-plan.md as context
```

**What happens:**
- AI reads the PRD and explores the codebase
- Interactive discussion about architecture, patterns, edge cases
- AI writes `.belmont/TECH_PLAN.md` with file structures, component specs, API types

### 4. Implement

Run the implementation pipeline. The AI finds the next incomplete milestone and works through each task using the 4-phase agent pipeline.

```
Claude Code:  /belmont:implement
Cursor:       Enable the belmont implement rule, then: "Implement the next milestone"
Other:        Load skills/belmont/implement.md as context
```

**What happens:**
1. Orchestrator creates `.belmont/MILESTONE.md` with task list, PRD context, and TECH_PLAN context
2. `codebase-agent` reads MILESTONE, scans codebase, writes patterns to MILESTONE *(parallel with 3)*
3. `design-agent` reads MILESTONE, loads Figma, writes design specs to MILESTONE *(parallel with 2)*
4. `implementation-agent` reads MILESTONE (only), writes code, tests, verification, commits
5. PRD.md and PROGRESS.md are updated, follow-up tasks created
6. MILESTONE file is archived (`MILESTONE-M2.done.md`)

**After all tasks in the milestone:**
- Milestone is marked complete in PROGRESS.md
- MILESTONE file is archived
- Summary is reported

### 5. Quick Fix (optional)

If verification created follow-up tasks or there's a small task to knock out, use `next` to implement just one task without the full pipeline overhead.

```
Claude Code:  /belmont:next
Cursor:       Enable the belmont next rule, then: "Implement the next task"
Other:        Load skills/belmont/next.md as context
```

**What happens:**
- Finds the next unchecked task in the current milestone
- Creates a minimal MILESTONE file with the task's context (skips analysis sub-agents)
- Dispatches the single task to the implementation agent
- Task is implemented, verified, committed, and marked complete
- MILESTONE file is archived
- Reports a brief summary

### 6. Verify

Run comprehensive verification on all completed work.

```
Claude Code:  /belmont:verify
Cursor:       Enable the belmont verify rule, then: "Verify the completed tasks"
Other:        Load skills/belmont/verify.md as context
```

**What happens:**
- Verification agent checks acceptance criteria, visual fidelity, i18n
- Code review agent runs build, tests, reviews code quality
- Issues become follow-up tasks in the PRD
- Combined report is produced

### 7. Review Alignment (recommended periodically)

After implementing milestones or making significant changes, review the alignment between your plans and the codebase.

```
Claude Code:  /belmont:review
Cursor:       Enable the belmont review rule, then: "Review document alignment"
Other:        Load skills/belmont/review.md as context
```

**What happens:**
- Reads all planning documents (PR/FAQ, master PRD, feature PRDs, tech plans, PROGRESS files)
- Scans codebase for implemented features and compares against plans
- Presents each discrepancy interactively with resolution options:
  - Update the planning document to match reality
  - Create a follow-up task to address the gap
  - Mark as intentional deviation
  - Skip
- Produces a summary of all findings and actions taken

### 8. Check Progress

Check where things stand at any point.

```
Claude Code:  /belmont:status
Cursor:       Enable the belmont status rule, then: "Show belmont status"
Other:        Load skills/belmont/status.md as context
```

### 9. Iterate

After implementing a milestone:
- Run `/belmont:verify` to catch issues
- Run `/belmont:next` to quickly fix follow-up tasks from verification
- Run `/belmont:review` to check alignment between plans and codebase
- Run `/belmont:implement` again for the next milestone
- Run `/belmont:status` to check progress
- Continue until all milestones are complete

### 10. Start Fresh

When you're done with a feature and want to plan something new:

```
Claude Code:  /belmont:reset
Cursor:       Enable the belmont reset rule, then: "Reset belmont state"
Other:        Load skills/belmont/reset.md as context
```

**What happens:**
- Agent reads current state and shows what will be cleared (feature name, tasks, milestones)
- Asks for explicit "yes" confirmation
- Resets PRD.md and PROGRESS.md to blank templates
- Deletes TECH_PLAN.md
- Prompts you to start fresh with `/belmont:product-plan`

**Key separation:**
- `.agents/belmont/` -- Shared agent instructions. Committed to git. Referenced by all tools.
- `.agents/skills/belmont/` -- Canonical skill files. Single source of truth.
- `.belmont/` -- Planning state (PR/FAQ, PRD, PROGRESS, TECH_PLAN, MILESTONE). Commit to git so the whole team has shared context.
- `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, etc. -- Tool-specific wiring. Some use symlinks, some use copied/synced files.

**Should I gitignore `.belmont/`?** Generally, no — commit it so planning docs (PR/FAQ, PRD, TECH_PLAN) are shared across the team. The only case to gitignore it is if you're a solo developer who wants to keep planning state purely local and ephemeral.

## Agent Pipeline Details

All implementation agents communicate through the **MILESTONE file** (`.belmont/MILESTONE.md`). Each agent reads its context from the file and writes its output to a designated section. This eliminates the need for the orchestrator to pass large outputs between agents.

### Phase 1: Codebase Scan (codebase-agent) — *parallel with Phase 2*

**File**: `.agents/belmont/codebase-agent.md` | **Model**: Sonnet

Reads the MILESTONE file, then scans the project:
- Framework, language, styling, testing stack
- Project structure and conventions
- Related code, utilities, and type definitions
- CLAUDE.md rules (if present)
- Import patterns, error handling patterns, test patterns

**Writes to**: `## Codebase Analysis` section of MILESTONE.md

### Phase 2: Design Analysis (design-agent) — *parallel with Phase 1*

**File**: `.agents/belmont/design-agent.md` | **Model**: Sonnet

Reads the MILESTONE file, then analyzes Figma designs when provided:
- Loads designs via Figma Plugin or MCP
- Extracts exact colors, typography, spacing, effects
- Maps to existing design system components
- Identifies new components to create
- Produces implementation-ready component code

**Writes to**: `## Design Specifications` section of MILESTONE.md

**Blocking**: If Figma URLs are provided but fail to load, the task is blocked.

### Phase 3: Implementation (implementation-agent) — *after Phases 1+2*

**File**: `.agents/belmont/implementation-agent.md` | **Model**: Opus

Reads the complete MILESTONE file (all research phases' output):
- Types/interfaces first, then utilities, then components
- Follows project patterns from `## Codebase Analysis`
- Uses design specifications from `## Design Specifications` for UI code
- Writes unit tests
- Runs verification: `tsc`, `lint:fix`, `test`, `build`
- Commits to git with structured commit message
- Reports out-of-scope issues as follow-up tasks

**Writes to**: `## Implementation Log` section of MILESTONE.md


### Verification (verification-agent)

**File**: `.agents/belmont/verification-agent.md` | **Model**: Sonnet

Verifies implementations against requirements:
- Reads PRD, TECH_PLAN, and archived MILESTONE files for context
- Acceptance criteria pass/fail
- Visual comparison with Figma (Playwright headless)
- i18n key verification
- Functional testing (happy path, edge cases, accessibility)

### Code Review (code-review-agent)

**File**: `.agents/belmont/code-review-agent.md` | **Model**: Sonnet

Reviews code for quality and alignment:
- Reads PRD, TECH_PLAN, and archived MILESTONE files for context
- Runs build and test commands (auto-detects the project's package manager)
- Checks pattern adherence and CLAUDE.md compliance
- Verifies PRD/tech plan alignment
- Security and performance review
- Categorizes issues: critical, warnings, suggestions

---

## Updating Belmont

### Self-update (recommended)

```bash
belmont update
```

This downloads the latest release binary from GitHub and replaces the current one. If you're in a project directory (`.belmont/` exists), it automatically re-runs `belmont install` to update skills and agents.

```bash
belmont update --check    # Check for updates without installing
belmont update --force    # Force update even if same version
```

### Re-install skills in a project

To refresh skills and agents without updating the CLI:

```bash
cd ~/your-project
belmont install
```

The installer detects changes between the embedded (or source) files and your installed files:
- **New files** are copied
- **Changed files** are updated
- **Renamed/deleted files** are removed from the target (keeps installed tree exact)
- **Unchanged files** are skipped
- **Symlinks** are verified and updated if needed
- `.belmont/` state files (PRD, PROGRESS, TECH_PLAN) are always preserved

### Developer updates

If you cloned the repo and built from source:

```bash
cd /path/to/belmont
git pull
./scripts/build.sh
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### `belmont` command not found

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep local
# If missing:
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Or re-run the installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blake-simpson/belmont/main/install.sh | sh
```

### No AI tools detected during install

If your project doesn't have a `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, etc. directory yet, the installer will ask which tool you're using and create the directory for you.

### Skills not showing up in Claude Code

Verify the agent symlink and copied command folder:

```bash
ls -la .claude/agents/belmont
# Should show: belmont -> ../../.agents/belmont

ls .claude/commands/belmont
# Should list the .md skill files

ls .agents/skills/belmont/
# Should list the .md skill files
```

If the symlink is missing or the skill directories are empty, re-run `belmont install` (or `belmont install --source /path/to/belmont`) and select Claude Code.

### Skills not showing up in Cursor

Cursor uses per-file symlinks with `.mdc` extension. Verify:

```bash
ls -la .cursor/rules/belmont/
# Should show .mdc symlinks pointing to .agents/skills/belmont/*.md
```

If you need to manually refresh, restart Cursor or reload the window.

### PRD is empty / template only

Run the product-plan skill first to create your PRD interactively. The tech-plan and implement skills require a populated PRD.

### Task marked as BLOCKED

Check `.belmont/PROGRESS.md` for blocker details. Common causes:
- Figma URL not accessible
- Missing context or dependencies
- Build/test failures that can't be auto-resolved

Fix the underlying issue, remove the `🚫 BLOCKED` marker from the task header in PRD.md, and re-run implement.

### Want to start fresh

Run the reset skill (`/belmont:reset` in Claude Code) to reset all state files. Alternatively, delete `.belmont/PRD.md`, `.belmont/PROGRESS.md`, `.belmont/TECH_PLAN.md`, `.belmont/MILESTONE.md`, and any `.belmont/MILESTONE-*.done.md` files manually, then re-run `belmont install` (or `belmont install --source /path/to/belmont`) to recreate templates.

## Requirements

- An AI coding tool (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini, Copilot, or any tool that reads markdown)
- [figma-mcp](https://github.com/nichochar/figma-mcp) (recommended) -- enables Belmont to load Figma designs, extract design tokens, and perform visual verification
- No Go required (pre-built binaries)
- No Docker required
- No Python required

**For contributors**: Go 1.21+ is needed to build from source. See [Developer Setup](#developer-setup-contributors).
