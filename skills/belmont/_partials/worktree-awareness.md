## Worktree Environment

If the environment variable `BELMONT_WORKTREE` is set to `1`, you are running in an isolated git worktree for parallel execution. The following rules apply:

- **Ports**: Use `$PORT` (or `$BELMONT_PORT`) when starting the **primary dev server**. Do NOT hardcode port numbers like 3000, 5173, or 8080. Examples: `next dev -p $PORT`, `vite --port $PORT`, `PORT=$PORT npm start`.
  - **For any OTHER server** (Storybook, Prisma Studio, documentation server, etc.): you MUST dynamically find a free port. Do NOT use the port from `package.json` scripts — it will conflict with other worktrees. Find a free port:
    ```bash
    FREE_PORT=$(python3 -c "import socket; s=socket.socket(); s.bind(('127.0.0.1',0)); print(s.getsockname()[1]); s.close()")
    ```
    Then start the server on that port: `npx storybook dev -p $FREE_PORT --no-open`, `npx prisma studio --port $FREE_PORT`, etc.
  - **NEVER run `npm run storybook`** or similar package.json scripts that hardcode ports. Always invoke the underlying command directly with your dynamically chosen port.
  - If a port is already in use, find another one — do not retry the same port.
- **Dependencies**: Worktree setup hooks have already run (e.g., `npm install`). Do NOT re-install dependencies unless a task specifically requires adding new packages.
- **Build isolation**: Your `.next/`, `dist/`, `node_modules/`, and other gitignored directories are local to this worktree. Other worktrees are unaffected by your builds.
- **Scope**: Only modify files within this worktree. Changes will be merged back via git.
