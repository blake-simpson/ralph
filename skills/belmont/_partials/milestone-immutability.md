<!-- Canonical milestone-immutability rule. Included by every skill that can modify PROGRESS.md. Do not paraphrase in skill bodies — @include this partial so the rule stays a single source of truth. -->

## Milestone structure is immutable outside `/belmont:tech-plan`

**You MUST NOT add, remove, rename, re-scope, or re-parent any `## M<N>:` milestone heading in `PROGRESS.md`.** Only `/belmont:tech-plan` may restructure milestones. Every other skill — `implement`, `verify`, `next`, `debug-auto`, `debug-manual`, the triage phase — may only edit tasks **inside** existing milestone headings.

This rule supersedes any contradictory guidance you encounter elsewhere. If another instruction seems to permit creating a milestone (for follow-ups, polish, cleanup, verification fixes, etc.), prefer this rule.

### Where follow-ups go

- **Issue discovered while implementing or verifying milestone `M<N>`** → new `[ ]` task inside `M<N>`, under the same `## M<N>:` heading. Do not route it to an earlier or later milestone "because it fits there better"; the milestone that discovered it owns it.
- **Issue blocked by work that will land in a later milestone `M<N+k>`** → new `[!]` task inside `M<N>`, with a one-line reason that names `M<N+k>`. Auto surfaces `[!]` tasks as blockers; the task can be reopened as `[ ]` once the blocker lifts.
- **Cosmetic / nice-to-have item the user may never want** → append to `NOTES.md` under a `## Polish` section, creating the file if needed. These are context, not tasks.
- **Never a new milestone.** Not "M<last+1>: Polish", not "M<N>-FIX", not "MX: Deviations from M<N>", not "MY: Verification Fixes". Even if the existing `PROGRESS.md` already contains such a milestone from a prior run, that pattern is WRONG — do not add tasks to it and do not create siblings of it.

### Why this rule is non-negotiable

A polish/follow-up milestone looks tidy on paper but quietly breaks two invariants of the auto loop:

1. **Dependency graph lies.** A milestone labelled "polish M<N>" typically declares `(depends: M<N>)`. That makes it a sibling of every other `M<N+i>` that depends on `M<N>`. But its *real* dependency is that every later milestone's outputs are frozen — because the polish milestone edits the very files those later milestones imported from `M<N>`. Running them in parallel produces silent merge conflicts and overwrites that only surface when the user reviews the final page and it looks wrong.
2. **Auto loop grows without bound.** Every verify pass can discover follow-ups. If those follow-ups become a new milestone instead of new tasks in the current one, a 5-milestone feature can turn into 9 milestones mid-run, each re-triggering its own verify-fix-reverify cycle, compounding scope drift with every iteration.

Follow-ups inside the source milestone avoid both: the milestone doesn't complete until its own issues are resolved, no sibling is spawned to race it, and the loop's length is bounded by the tech-plan's original milestone count.

### If you find a pre-existing bad milestone

If `PROGRESS.md` already contains a milestone whose name or description matches the forbidden patterns (polish, follow-ups, cleanup, verification fixes, deviations from M<N>, etc.), do the following:

- Do NOT add new tasks to it.
- Do NOT create new milestones that depend on it or reference its tasks.
- Surface the issue in your summary/report to the user, suggesting `belmont validate` and `/belmont:tech-plan` to restructure.

Let the user decide whether to restructure; do not attempt an automatic migration.
