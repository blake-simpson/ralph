### Core Principle

You are the **orchestrator**. You MUST NOT perform the agent work yourself. Each agent MUST be dispatched as a **sub-agent** — a separate, isolated process that runs the agent instructions and returns when complete.

**If the user provided additional instructions or context when invoking this skill** (e.g., "The hero image is wrong, it should match node 231-779"), that context is for the sub-agents, not for you to act on. Your only job is to forward it. See "User Context Forwarding" below.

### Choosing Your Dispatch Method

Use the **first** approach below whose required tools are available to you. Check your available tools **by name** — do not guess or skip ahead.

---

#### Approach A: Agent Teams (preferred)

**Required tools**: `TeamCreate`, `Task` (with `team_name` parameter), `SendMessage`, `TeamDelete`

If ALL of these tools are available to you, you MUST use this approach:

1. **Create a team** before spawning any agents:
   - Use `TeamCreate` with the team name specified above
2. **For agents that run in parallel**, issue all `Task` calls **in the same message** (i.e., as parallel tool calls). All calls use:
   - `team_name`: The team name you created
   - `name`: The agent role (e.g., `"codebase-agent"`, `"verification-agent"`)
   - `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"` (all belmont agents need full tool access including file editing and bash)
   - `mode`: `"bypassPermissions"`
   - Do **NOT** set `run_in_background: true`
3. Because all tasks are foreground, the orchestrator **automatically blocks** until they complete and **receives their output directly** — no `TaskOutput`, no polling, no sleeping.
4. **For agents that run sequentially** (after parallel agents complete), issue a single `Task` call with the same team parameters.
5. **Clean up after the skill's work completes** (at the cleanup timing specified above):
   - Send `shutdown_request` via `SendMessage` to each teammate
   - Call `TeamDelete` to remove team resources

---

#### Approach B: Parallel Foreground Sub-Agents

**Required tools**: `Task`

If `Task` is available but `TeamCreate` is NOT:

1. **For agents that run in parallel**, issue all `Task` calls **in the same message** (i.e., as parallel tool calls). All calls use:
   - `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"` (all belmont agents need full tool access including file editing and bash)
   - `mode`: `"bypassPermissions"`
   - Do **NOT** set `run_in_background: true`
2. Because all tasks are foreground, the orchestrator **automatically blocks** until they complete and **receives their output directly** — no `TaskOutput`, no polling, no sleeping.
3. **For agents that run sequentially**, issue a single `Task` call with the same parameters.

No team cleanup needed.

---

#### Approach C: Sequential Inline Execution (fallback)

If neither `TeamCreate` nor `Task` is available:

1. For each agent, read its agent file (e.g., `.agents/belmont/<agent-name>.md`)
2. Execute its instructions fully within your own context
3. Complete all output before moving to the next agent
4. Do NOT blend agent work together — finish one completely before starting the next

---

### Important: Foreground, Not Background

**Do NOT use `run_in_background: true`** in Approaches A or B. Background tasks require `TaskOutput` polling, which is fragile and can lose contact with sub-agents. Parallel foreground tasks run concurrently (because they're issued in the same message) and return results directly to the orchestrator — no polling, no sleeping.

---

### User Context Forwarding (CRITICAL)

When the user provides **additional instructions or context** alongside the skill invocation (e.g., `/belmont:verify The hero image is wrong...`), you MUST:

1. **Capture** the user's additional context verbatim
2. **Include it in every sub-agent prompt** as an "Additional Context from User" section
3. **DO NOT act on it yourself** — your job is to pass it through, not to do the work

Format for including user context in sub-agent prompts:
```
> **Additional Context from User**:
> [paste the user's additional instructions/context here verbatim]
```

Append this block to the end of each sub-agent's prompt, after the standard prompt content. If the user provided no additional context, omit this block entirely.

**Why this matters**: The orchestrator seeing actionable instructions (e.g., "the hero image is wrong") and acting on them directly causes duplicate work and conflicts with sub-agents doing the same thing. The orchestrator's role is delegation, not execution.

---

### Dispatch Rules (apply to ALL approaches)

1. **DO NOT** read `.agents/belmont/*-agent.md` files yourself (unless using Approach C) — the sub-agents read them
2. **DO NOT** perform the sub-agents' work yourself — sub-agents do this
3. **DO** prepare all required context before spawning any sub-agent
4. **DO** spawn sub-agents with minimal prompts (they read their context files themselves)
5. **DO** wait for sub-agents to complete before proceeding to the next step
6. **DO** handle blockers and errors reported by sub-agents
7. **DO** include the full sub-agent preamble (identity + mandatory agent file) in every sub-agent prompt
8. **DO** forward any user-provided context to every sub-agent (see "User Context Forwarding" above)
