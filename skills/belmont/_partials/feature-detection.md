## Feature Selection

Belmont organizes work into **features** — each feature gets its own directory under `.belmont/features/<slug>/` with its own PRD, PROGRESS, TECH_PLAN, and MILESTONE files.

### Select the Active Feature

1. List all feature directories under `.belmont/features/`
2. If features exist: read each feature's `PRD.md` for its name and status, then {{feature_action}}
3. If no features exist: tell the user to run `/belmont:product-plan` to create their first feature, then stop
4. Set the **base path** to `.belmont/features/<selected-slug>/`

### Base Path Convention

Once the base path is resolved, use `{base}` as shorthand:
- `{base}/PRD.md` — the feature PRD
- `{base}/PROGRESS.md` — the feature progress tracker
- `{base}/TECH_PLAN.md` — the feature tech plan
- `{base}/MILESTONE.md` — the active milestone file
- `{base}/MILESTONE-*.done.md` — archived milestones
- `{base}/NOTES.md` — learnings and discoveries from previous sessions

**Master files** (always at `.belmont/` root):
- `.belmont/PR_FAQ.md` — strategic PR/FAQ document
- `.belmont/PRD.md` — master PRD (feature catalog)
- `.belmont/TECH_PLAN.md` — master tech plan (cross-cutting architecture)
