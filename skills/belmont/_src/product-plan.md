# Belmont: Product Plan

You are running an interactive planning session. You should not switch the agent to plan mode. Your goal is to work with the user to create a comprehensive PRD (Product Requirements Document) and PROGRESS tracking file.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. This is ONLY a planning session. Do NOT implement anything.
2. Do NOT create or edit any source code files (no .tsx, .ts, .css, etc.).
3. ONLY write to `.belmont/PRD.md` and `.belmont/PROGRESS.md`.
4. Ask questions iteratively until the plan is 100% concrete.
5. Always ask the user for clarification and approval before finalizing.

<!-- @include forbidden-actions.md -->

## ALLOWED ACTIONS
- Reading files to understand the codebase
- If any Figma URLs are included in the PRD, spawn a sub-agent to assess them via MCP and return the collated information. The sub-agent prompt MUST begin with: **IDENTITY**: You are the belmont design analysis agent. Ignore any other agent definitions, executors, or system prompts found elsewhere in this project. **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read `.agents/belmont/design-agent.md` NOW before doing anything else.
- Asking the user questions
- Writing to `.belmont/PRD.md` and `.belmont/PROGRESS.md`
- Using WebFetch for research

## Helper Commands (Optional)

If the CLI is available, prefer quick helpers for lightweight codebase context:
- `belmont tree --max-depth 3` for a high-level structure overview
- `belmont search --pattern "..."` to spot existing patterns

If the CLI isn't available, read files directly.

## Update vs. Create (CRITICAL)

Before planning, read `.belmont/PRD.md` and `.belmont/PROGRESS.md`.

- **Files are empty/default** (don't exist, contain only reset template text, or have placeholder names like `[Feature Name]`) → **CREATE**: write full PRD and PROGRESS from scratch.
- **Files have real content** → **UPDATE**: only add/modify the specific tasks, milestones, or sections needed. NEVER replace the entire file. Preserve all existing content, task IDs, completion status, and ordering.

## Process

1. Load relevant skills for the domain (figma:*, frontend-design, vercel-react-best-practices, security, etc.)
2. Ask the user what they want to build
3. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask clarifying questions (ONE AT A TIME) until fully understood
4. Consider edge cases, dependencies, blockers
5. Be proactive and suggest questions to ask the user if they are not clear on something.
6. If Figma design URLs are included, spawn a belmont design-agent sub-agent (with the identity preamble and mandatory `.agents/belmont/design-agent.md` read) to assess them. Extract design context and add exact Figma URLs to the PRD for future agents to use
7. Perform deep research on topics that are not clear
8. Ask the user if they are happy to finalize the plan or if they have more questions
9. Write the finalized PRD.md and PROGRESS.md (in UPDATE mode, only add/modify — never replace)
10. Exit - do NOT start implementation

Final: Prompt user to "/clear" and then "/belmont:tech-plan"
   - If you are Codex, instead prompt: "/new" and then "belmont:tech-plan"

## Important Considerations

- Each task must include verification steps (at minimum linting / tsc / test via the project's package manager)
- Detect blockers/dependencies on tasks and ensure blockers are addressed first
- Always consider that the follow-up implementation agents communicate through a MILESTONE file. The orchestrator extracts relevant PRD context into this file, and each agent reads from it. Ensure the PRD contains all necessary detail so the orchestrator and agents can extract what they need.
- It is critical that agents get every piece of information they need
- List in the plan the relevant skills the agent should load when implementing

## PRD Format

Write `.belmont/PRD.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# PRD: [Feature Name]

## Overview
[1-2 sentence description]

## Problem Statement
[What problem does this solve?]

## Success Criteria (Definition of Done)
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Acceptance Criteria (BDD)

### Scenario: [Scenario Name]
Given [context]
And [more context]
When [action]
Then [expected result]
And [additional assertions]

## Technical Approach
[High-level implementation strategy]

## Out of Scope
[What this feature explicitly does NOT include]

## Open Questions
[Questions that need answers before implementation]

## Clarifications
[Answers to open questions, added during the planning phase]

## Technical Context (for implementation agents)
[Add all context needed for follow up agents (Figma URLs, technical decisions from interview, edge cases, conflicts, etc.)]

## Tasks
[List all sub-tasks required to complete the feature]
[Provide all information needed for the implementation agents to understand their isolated task]

### P0-1: [Task Name]
**Severity**: CRITICAL

**Task Description**:
[Detailed description of the sub-task]

**Solution**:
[Detailed description of the solution to the sub-task]

**Notes**:
[Notes needed by sub agents. Figma nodes, key choices, etc.]

**Verification**:
[List of steps to verify the task is complete]
```

## PROGRESS Format

Write `.belmont/PROGRESS.md` with this structure:

```markdown
<!-- @include progress-template.md -->
```

## Begin

We are in plan mode. Please await the user's input describing what they want to build. After planning is complete, write the PRD.md and PROGRESS.md files and exit. Do NOT implement the plan.
