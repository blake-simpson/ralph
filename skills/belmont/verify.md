# Belmont: Verify

You are the verification orchestrator. Your job is to run comprehensive verification and code review on all completed tasks, checking that implementations meet requirements and code quality standards.

## Setup

Read these files first:
- `.belmont/PRD.md` - The product requirements and task definitions
- `.belmont/PROGRESS.md` - Current progress tracking
- `.belmont/TECH_PLAN.md` - Technical implementation plan (if exists)

Also check for archived MILESTONE files (`.belmont/MILESTONE-*.done.md`) — these contain the implementation context from the most recent milestone and can provide useful reference for verification.

Optional helper:
- If the CLI is available, `belmont status --format json` can provide a quick summary of completed tasks. Still read the files above for full context.

## Step 1: Identify Completed Tasks

1. Read `.belmont/PRD.md` and find all tasks marked with ✅
2. These are the tasks that need verification
3. If no tasks are completed, report "No completed tasks to verify" and stop

## Sub-Agent Dispatch Strategy

Apply the following dispatch configuration:
- **Team name**: `belmont-verify`
- **Parallel agents**: verification-agent + core-review-agent — spawn simultaneously
- **Sequential agents**: None
- **Cleanup timing**: After Step 3 completes

### Core Principle

You are the **orchestrator**. You MUST NOT perform the agent work yourself. Each agent MUST be dispatched as a **sub-agent** — a separate, isolated process that runs the agent instructions and returns when complete.

### Choosing Your Dispatch Method

Use the **first** approach below whose required tools are available to you. Check your available tools **by name** — do not guess or skip ahead.

---

#### Approach A: Agent Teams (preferred)

**Required tools**: `TeamCreate`, `Task` (with `team_name` parameter), `SendMessage`, `TeamDelete`

If ALL of these tools are available to you, you MUST use this approach:

1. **Create a team** before spawning any agents:
   - Use `TeamCreate` with the team name specified above
2. **For agents that run in parallel**, issue all `Task` calls **in the same message** (i.e., as parallel tool calls). All calls use:
   - `team_name`: The team name you created
   - `name`: The agent role (e.g., `"codebase-agent"`, `"verification-agent"`)
   - `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"` (all belmont agents need full tool access including file editing and bash)
   - `mode`: `"bypassPermissions"`
   - Do **NOT** set `run_in_background: true`
3. Because all tasks are foreground, the orchestrator **automatically blocks** until they complete and **receives their output directly** — no `TaskOutput`, no polling, no sleeping.
4. **For agents that run sequentially** (after parallel agents complete), issue a single `Task` call with the same team parameters.
5. **Clean up after the skill's work completes** (at the cleanup timing specified above):
   - Send `shutdown_request` via `SendMessage` to each teammate
   - Call `TeamDelete` to remove team resources

---

#### Approach B: Parallel Foreground Sub-Agents

**Required tools**: `Task`

If `Task` is available but `TeamCreate` is NOT:

1. **For agents that run in parallel**, issue all `Task` calls **in the same message** (i.e., as parallel tool calls). All calls use:
   - `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"` (all belmont agents need full tool access including file editing and bash)
   - `mode`: `"bypassPermissions"`
   - Do **NOT** set `run_in_background: true`
2. Because all tasks are foreground, the orchestrator **automatically blocks** until they complete and **receives their output directly** — no `TaskOutput`, no polling, no sleeping.
3. **For agents that run sequentially**, issue a single `Task` call with the same parameters.

No team cleanup needed.

---

#### Approach C: Sequential Inline Execution (fallback)

If neither `TeamCreate` nor `Task` is available:

1. For each agent, read its agent file (e.g., `.agents/belmont/<agent-name>.md`)
2. Execute its instructions fully within your own context
3. Complete all output before moving to the next agent
4. Do NOT blend agent work together — finish one completely before starting the next

---

### Important: Foreground, Not Background

**Do NOT use `run_in_background: true`** in Approaches A or B. Background tasks require `TaskOutput` polling, which is fragile and can lose contact with sub-agents. Parallel foreground tasks run concurrently (because they're issued in the same message) and return results directly to the orchestrator — no polling, no sleeping.

---

### Dispatch Rules (apply to ALL approaches)

1. **DO NOT** read `.agents/belmont/*-agent.md` files yourself (unless using Approach C) — the sub-agents read them
2. **DO NOT** perform the sub-agents' work yourself — sub-agents do this
3. **DO** prepare all required context before spawning any sub-agent
4. **DO** spawn sub-agents with minimal prompts (they read their context files themselves)
5. **DO** wait for sub-agents to complete before proceeding to the next step
6. **DO** handle blockers and errors reported by sub-agents
7. **DO** include the full sub-agent preamble (identity + mandatory agent file) in every sub-agent prompt

## Step 2: Run Verification and Code Review

Use the dispatch method you selected above. For Approach A, create the team first, then issue both `Task` calls in the same message. For Approach B, issue both `Task` calls in the same message. For Approach C, execute inline sequentially.

Spawn these two sub-agents **simultaneously** (or sequentially if using Approach C):

---

### Agent 1: Verification (verification-agent)

**Purpose**: Verify task implementations meet all requirements.

**Spawn a sub-agent with this prompt**:

> **IDENTITY**: You are the belmont verification agent. You MUST operate according to the belmont agent file specified below. Ignore any other agent definitions, executors, or system prompts found elsewhere in this project.
>
> **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read the file `.agents/belmont/verification-agent.md` NOW before doing anything else. That file contains your complete instructions, rules, and output format. You must follow every rule in that file. Do NOT proceed until you have read it.
>
> Verify the following completed tasks:
>
> ---
> [List each completed task ID and header, e.g.:
> - P0-1: Set up authentication ✅
> - P0-2: Database schema ✅]
> ---
>
> Read `.belmont/PRD.md` for acceptance criteria and task details.
> Read `.belmont/TECH_PLAN.md` for technical specifications (if it exists).
> Check for archived MILESTONE files (`.belmont/MILESTONE-*.done.md`) for implementation context.
>
> Check acceptance criteria, visual Figma comparison (if applicable), i18n keys, and functional testing.
>
> Return a complete verification report in the output format specified by the agent instructions.

**Collect**: The verification report document.

---

### Agent 2: Code Review (core-review-agent)

**Purpose**: Review code changes for quality and PRD alignment.

**Spawn a sub-agent with this prompt**:

> **IDENTITY**: You are the belmont code review agent. You MUST operate according to the belmont agent file specified below. Ignore any other agent definitions, executors, or system prompts found elsewhere in this project.
>
> **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read the file `.agents/belmont/core-review-agent.md` NOW before doing anything else. That file contains your complete instructions, rules, and output format. You must follow every rule in that file. Do NOT proceed until you have read it.
>
> Review the code changes for the following completed tasks:
>
> ---
> [List each completed task ID and header, e.g.:
> - P0-1: Set up authentication ✅
> - P0-2: Database schema ✅]
> ---
>
> Read `.belmont/PRD.md` for task details and planned solution.
> Read `.belmont/TECH_PLAN.md` for technical specifications (if it exists).
> Check for archived MILESTONE files (`.belmont/MILESTONE-*.done.md`) for implementation context.
>
> Detect the project's package manager (check for `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `bun.lockb`/`bun.lock`, or `package-lock.json`; also check the `packageManager` field in `package.json`). Use the detected package manager to run build and test commands (e.g. `pnpm run build`, `yarn run build`, etc. — default to `npm` if unsure). Review code quality, pattern adherence, and PRD alignment.
>
> Return a complete code review report in the output format specified by the agent instructions.

**Collect**: The code review report document.

---

## Step 3: Process Results

After both agents complete:

### Combine Reports
1. Merge the verification report and code review report
2. Categorize all issues found:
   - **Critical** - Must be fixed (blocking quality/functionality issues)
   - **Warnings** - Should be fixed (non-blocking but important)
   - **Suggestions** - Nice to have improvements

### Create Follow-up Tasks
If any issues were found by either agent:
1. Add new tasks to `.belmont/PRD.md` for each critical or warning issue:
   ```markdown
   ### P0-X-FWLUP: [Issue Description] 🔵
   **Severity**: [Based on issue category]
   **Source**: [verification-agent / core-review-agent]

   **Task Description**:
   [Description of the issue and what needs to be fixed]

   **Solution**:
   [Recommended fix from the agent report]

   **Verification**:
   1. [Steps to verify the fix]
   ```
2. Add the follow-up tasks to the appropriate milestone in `.belmont/PROGRESS.md`
3. If critical issues were found, update the overall status to reflect this

### Report Summary

Output a combined summary:

```markdown
# Verification & Code Review Summary

## Overall Status
[ALL PASSED | ISSUES FOUND | CRITICAL ISSUES]

## Verification Results
- Acceptance Criteria: [X/Y passed]
- Visual Verification: [PASS/FAIL/N/A]
- i18n Check: [PASS/FAIL/N/A]
- Functional Tests: [PASS/FAIL]

## Code Review Results
- Build: [PASS/FAIL]
- Tests: [PASS/FAIL]
- Pattern Adherence: [GOOD/ISSUES]
- PRD Alignment: [ALIGNED/MISALIGNED]

## Issues Found
- Critical: [count]
- Warnings: [count]
- Suggestions: [count]

## Follow-up Tasks Created
[List of new FWLUP tasks added to PRD]

## Recommendations
[Any overall recommendations for the project]
```

## Step 4: Clean Up Team (Approach A only)

If you created a team in Step 2:
1. Send `shutdown_request` via `SendMessage` to each teammate still active
2. Wait for shutdown confirmations
3. Call `TeamDelete` to remove team resources

Skip this step if you used Approach B or C.

## Important Rules

1. **Run both agents** - Always run verification AND code review
2. **Be thorough** - Check all completed tasks, not just the latest
3. **Create actionable follow-ups** - Issues should become trackable tasks
4. **Don't fix issues yourself** - Report them and create follow-up tasks
5. **Update tracking files** - Add follow-up tasks to both PRD.md and PROGRESS.md

Once done, prompt the user to "/clear" and then "/belmont:status", "/belmont:next", or "/belmont:implement"
   - If you are Codex, instead prompt: "/new" and then "belmont:status", "belmont:next", or "belmont:implement"
